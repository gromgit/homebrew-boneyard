# Homebrew Boneyard: where core formulae go to die

These formulae were removed from Homebrew core because there were no longer being maintained.

## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install gromgit/boneyard/<formula>`

Or `brew tap gromgit/boneyard` and then `brew install <formula>`.

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
